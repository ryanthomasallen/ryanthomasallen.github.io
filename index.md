# Overview

I'm a PhD candidate at Harvard Business School. I conduct research at the intersection of innovation strategy, organization theory, and entrepreneurship.

In my <a href="https://ryantallen.com/research/#dissertation-working-papers" target="_blank">dissertation research</a> I investigate how organizations use analytics and experimentation to make high-uncertainty strategic decisions. In the context of new product innovation, I identify when relying on analytics and experimentation is beneficial, and when it can be misleading. Click for more details:

<li>In <strong>chapter 1 (my job market paper)</strong>, I ask whether organizations with data-driven cultures are more innovative. This question has evoked polarized viewpoints: some argue that reliance on quantitative data increases innovative foresight by reducing the biases inherent in softer methods, whereas others argue that such reliance leads to merely incremental innovation. I show that it depends on what I call the <i>methodological pluralism</i> of organizational culture—the extent to which different kinds of analyses are valued in the organization. Using data on 3,500 product launches and text from employee résumés at 61 large consumer product firms, I show that increasing quantitative analysis decreases innovation performance when qualitative analysis is low, and, conversely, increases when qualitative analysis is high.  A culture dominated by quantitative analysis is especially harmful when launching products that are novel, or when targeting markets characterized by higher uncertainty.</li>
  
<li>In <strong>chapter 2</strong>, I use an agent-based model to explain the underlying reason why demand for new innovations can be difficult to anticipate using data-driven methods. In my model, customers are more uncertain of their evaluations of novel products,  so their evaluations are more interdependent with neighbors’ evaluations. This leads to counterintuitive diffusion dynamics that can systematically downward bias <i>ex ante</i> estimates of new products’ quantitative market size estimates. I empirically validate the model with data on over 2,000 consumer product launches.</li>
    
<li>In <strong>chapter 3</strong>, I shift my focus to product innovation in a different organizational form—user communities. Using longitudinal data on 500 new PC game launches, I show that firms’ innovation trajectories can get derailed when innovators are too responsive to experimentation in highly concentrated user communities that are not representative of the broader market.</li>
