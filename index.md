# Overview

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Management and Organization department at the University of Washington.

I study how organizations use data and AI in innovation. My <a href="https://ryantallen.com/research/" target="_blank">research</a> projects fall under two broad research streams.

In one research stream, I study how organizations use data and experimentation to identify innovation opportunities with significant commercial potential. For example, my most recent paper, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00018392251313737" target="_blank">Methodological Pluralism and Innovation in Data-driven Organizations</a>, explains when data-driven innovation approaches can be misleading and when they can be helpful.

In another research stream, I study how AI impacts strategic decision-making. In one working paper, I'm studying how well <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5239555" target="_blank">AI performs in strategy simulations</a> compared to MBA students. I have prior publications on <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2021.1554" target="_blank">how human domain experience impacts taking algorithmic advice</a>, and on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3215" target="_blank">machine learning methods</a> in research.

These current research interests build on my <a href="https://ryantallen.com/research/#publications" target="_blank">prior publications</a> on <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-022-00570-2" target="_blank">innovation in global R&D</a> and <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/stsc.2021.0130" target="_blank">shifting category dynamics in emerging industries</a>.  
  
I got my PhD at Harvard. Before that, I studied Economics at BYU, served a 2-year mission in Taiwan for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, conducted economic research on environmental health issues, managed at a nonprofit, and did a stint as data analyst at Amazon. I live in Newcastle, WA with my wife and 4 children.
