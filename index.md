# Overview

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Management and Organization department at the University of Washington.

I study how organizations search for high-potential innovation opportunities. While much strategy research centers on supply-side technological uncertainty—exploring how organizations integrate external knowledge to develop new technologies—my research shifts attention to demand-side market uncertainty, exploring how organizations identify untapped demand among potential customers. Specifically, I examine how customer feedback, data analytics, and experimentation significantly influence the search for these opportunities. While it is commonly recommended in practice to adhere closely to observable demand indicators, I develop and test new theories that challenge the efficacy of these recommendations and explore conditions under which they may be misleading.

I got my PhD at Harvard. Before that, I studied Economics at BYU, served a 2-year mission in Taiwan for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, conducted economic research on environmental health issues, managed at a nonprofit, and did a stint as data analyst at Amazon. I live in Newcastle, WA with my wife and 4 children.
