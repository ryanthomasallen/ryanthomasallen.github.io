This is the repository for my professional online CV website, hosted through Github Pages.  
  
If you want to make a similar web page for yourself, I found [this site](https://www.codingwithricky.com/2021/05/10/intro-to-github-pages-create-a-simple-and-free-personal-website/) very helpful

Note to self - I still need to add:
- (LAYOUT PAGE) An updated picture
- (TEACHING PAGE) A description of my teaching interests and philosophy
- (RESEARCH PAGE) Brief description of general research agenda - where there is deep connections between theory and phenomenon. Behavioral strategy, cognition and search
- (RESEARCH PAGE) Add abstracts to published papers?
- (CV) Move teaching section below honors and awards
