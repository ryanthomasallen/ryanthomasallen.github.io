This is the repository for my professional online CV website, hosted through Github Pages.  
  
If you want to make I similar web page for yourself, I found [this site](https://www.codingwithricky.com/2021/05/10/intro-to-github-pages-create-a-simple-and-free-personal-website/) very helpful

I still need to add:
- (LAYOUT PAGE) An updated picture
- (TEACHING PAGE) A description of my teaching interests and philosophy
- (RESEARCH PAGE) Other research and Taobao case
- (RESEARCH PAGE) Where I've submitted each working paper
- (RESEARCH PAGE) abstract for paper with Aticus
